The Soviet Union was willing to bear the cost of moving the Chinese to the Soviet inland and Xinjiang, provided that the local government organises the repatriation of the Chinese in batches; 2. The Soviet Union will assist the Chinese in disposing of their real estate by selling it or entrusting it to others, or if there is no equivalent agent, by handing it over to the consulate, but the consulate shall not concentrate a large number of properties. The foreign affairs section of the city government will compile a list of Chinese nationals to be deported in accordance with the method stipulated in Article 3, and make a copy of the list indicating the time of transportation, and send it to the consulates in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk by letter of the diplomat for the record; 6. The Soviet wives of Chinese nationals may also return with them to their home countries; 7. The Soviet side agrees in principle to deport the arrested Chinese nationals, but only if they have not committed a serious crime.

Despite the mistreatment of Chinese workers, many of whom paid with their lives, the majority of them were able to maintain a basic living through hard work and thrift before the October Revolution. After the October Revolution, the situation of Chinese workers worsened, and all Russian factions competed with each other to bully them: where the White Russians went, there were often 'unburied corpses of Chinese diasporas, which had suffered wounds from guns and knives, or were stripped of their clothes and died of cold'; the Soviet Red Army was not far behind, 'raping and abusing them, and setting fire to their houses and goods'. Anyone who did not speak Russian was accused by the radicals of being a traitor, and their money and clothes were stripped from them and their lives were injured'; the British, American and Japanese troops in Siberia also searched for Chinese workers without a reason, and when they found anything suspicious, they immediately charged them with 'Red Party' crimes and killed them without asking a question.

It is well known that the Chinese diaspora in Vladivostok was the largest after the Russian population, as evidenced by official statistics. The Chinese played a key role in many areas of urban life. Chinese labor was in great demand in Vladivostok during the entire period of imperial rule and at the initial stage of Soviet rule, right up to the mass expulsion of Chinese in 1938.

Compared to the Russians, they were more popular with Russian business and industry because of their low wages, ease of management, high labour efficiency, and few bad habits such as alcoholism, and especially their perseverance and endurance, which was 'beyond the reach of Russian workers'. However, it was this competitive advantage and growing numbers that caused growing concern in the Russian government and society, in which some groups even seeing it as a 'highly dangerous source' for Russia's nation, defence and economy. The most extreme of such ideologies was the popular notion of 'Yellow Perils' during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

However, when the Chinese demanded a written guarantee from the Soviet side, the Soviet Union refused, and the Director of the Far East Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and People's Commissariat said, 'We do not use written form in handling such cases with other countries, because the sincerity of the two countries in resolving the cases does not lie in the form of writing but in the practical implementation.' The Chinese side again backed down for the sake of the war effort and did not insist on a written guarantee from the Soviet Union.

After the outbreak of the October Revolution, Russia was plunged into civil unrest for five years , and many Chinese expatriates in Russia were caught in the crossfire. Some of them  joined the Soviet Red Army in the fight against the White Russians and contributed to the victory of the Soviet Revolution, while most of them returned to their homeland in various ways, for example, with the help of the Beiyang government, the Chinese Workers' Association in Russia and the Chinese Red Cross.

Similar to the situation before the war, most of the Chinese entering the country during this period were seasonal workers, constantly entering and returning to their homeland, and because many illegal entrants were omitted from the statistics due to the capacity of the Soviet statistical services, the actual number of Chinese should be much higher than the statistics at that time.

Although the Soviet Union wanted to relocate the Koreans, it did not do so because of the special status of the Koreans , but when Japan was at war with China and had no time for the Far East, the Soviet Union launched a large-scale forced relocation of the Koreans. It is hard to say that it was purely a coincidence that the Soviet Union forcibly relocated Koreans and Chinese after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

That which has long been
The Great Mother of God
At the beginning of February 1911, the Russian Ambassador to China informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Qing Government that, due to the need to prevent epidemics, it was proposed to deport unemployed Chinese people from the coastal provinces to China, and that all expenses should be borne by the Chinese. Subsequently, without consulting the Chinese, the Russians first arrested 500 Chinese in Khabarovsk and sent them to Vladivostok  to be forcibly repatriated to China, and then arrested a large number of Chinese in Vladivostok and Nikolaevsk, where the Chinese had gathered, and forcibly drove them back to China. Telegraphs were sent from Heilongjiang and Jilin reporting the forcible internment and deportation of Chinese.

Although Chinese workers were described as 'undoubtedly the greatest enemy of the Russian frontier and a great threat at the political level', the congress refused to adopt any extreme exclusionary measures, considering the indispensable role of the Chinese in local industry and commerce, and argued that 'the struggle against Chinese workers can only be carried out through the continuous attraction of Russian workers to the frontier'.

In addition, Deribas was instructed to 'carry out further liquidation of the 'Millionka' with greater caution, without giving grounds for accusations that this action is directed exclusively against the Chinese. The terms and order of eviction should be coordinated with the NCID, so that liquidation of 'Millionka' could be completed no later than this year.

First, literacy education was introduced among foreign immigrants. The establishment of Chinese associations and trade unions was encouraged, and Chinese newspapers were allowed to be established. However, in the absence of teachers at that time, there were simply no teachers who could teach Russian to the Chinese. Students often could only read the sounds but not understand the meaning. By 1929, out of the 598 Chinese who participated in literacy education, only 116 had completed the entire course, and the vast majority of Chinese were still illiterate. Second, Chinese newspapers were allowed to be established and Chinese trade unions were organised. Huagong Xingshibao was founded in Chita in 1922, sponsored by the Chita Chinese Workers' Association, to propagate proletarian revolutionary ideas to Chinese workers.
