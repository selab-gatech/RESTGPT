              The estimated loss is the difference between the amount disbursed
              from the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to cover obligations to
              insured depositors and the amount estimated to be ultimately
              recovered from the liquidation of the receivership estate.
              Estimated losses reflect unpaid principal amounts deemed
              unrecoverable and do not reflect interest that may be due on the
              DIF's administrative or subrogated claims should its principal be
              repaid in full.

              Notes:

              Comprehensive data on estimated losses are not available for
              FDIC-insured failures prior to 1986, or for FSLIC-insured failures
              from 1934-88. Estimated loss is presented as "N/A" in years for
              which comprehensive information is not available.

              Estimated Loss data was previously referred to as 'Estimated Cost'
              in past releases of the Historical Statistic on Banking. For RTC
              receiverships, the 'Estimated Cost' included an allocation of FDIC
              corporate revenue and expense items such as interest expense on
              Federal Financing Bank debt, interest expense on escrowed funds
              and interest revenue on advances to receiverships. Other FDIC
              receiverships did not include such an allocation. To maintain
              consistency with FDIC receiverships, the RTC allocation is no
              longer reflected in the estimated loss amounts for failed /
              assisted institutions that were resolved through RTC
              receiverships.

              Beginning with the release of 2007 information, the 'Estimated
              Loss' in the Historical Statistics on Banking is presented and
              defined consistently with the aggregate Estimated Receivership
              Loss for FRF-RTC institutions and Estimated Losses for FDIC
              receiverships that are reported in the FDIC's Annual Report. The
              estimated loss is obtained from the FDIC's Failed Bank Cost
              Analysis (FBCA) report and the RTC Loss report. The FBCA provides
              data for receiverships back to 1986. The RTC Loss Report provides
              similar data back to 1989.

            description: "Institutions have been resolved through several different types of transactions. The transaction types outlined below can be grouped into three general categories, based upon the method employed to protect insured depositors and how each transaction affects a failed / assisted institution's charter. In most assistance transactions, insured and uninsured depositors are protected, the failed / assisted institution remains open and its charter survives the resolution process. In purchase and assumption transactions, the failed / assisted institution's insured deposits are transferred to a successor institution, and its charter is closed. In most of these transactions, additional liabilities and assets are also transferred to the successor institution. In payoff transactions, the deposit insurer - the FDIC or the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation - pays insured depositors, the failed / assisted institution's charter is closed, and there is no successor institution. For a more complete description of resolution transactions and the FDIC's receivership activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a study prepared by the FDIC's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. Copies are available from the FDIC's Public Information Center.\nCategory 1 - Institution's charter survives\nA/A\t- Assistance Transactions. These include: 1) transactions where assistance was provided to the acquirer, who purchased the entire institution. For a few FSLIC transactions, the acquirer purchased the entire bridge bank - type entity, but certain other assets were moved into a liquidating receivership prior to the sale, and 2) open bank assistance transactions, including those where assistance was provided under a systemic risk determination (in such cases any costs that exceed the amounts estimated under the least cost resolution requirement would be recovered through a special assessment on all FDIC-insured institutions).\nREP -\tReprivatization, management takeover with or without assistance at takeover, followed by a sale with or without additional assistance.\nCategory 2 - Institution's charter is terminated, insured deposits plus some assets and other liabilities are transferred to a successor charter\nP&A - Purchase and Assumption, where some or all of the deposits, certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets (sometimes all of the assets) were sold to an acquirer. It was not determined if all of the deposits (PA) or only the insured deposits (PI) were assumed.\nPA - Purchase and Assumption, where the insured and uninsured deposits, certain other liabilities and a portion of the assets were sold to an acquirer.\nPI - Purchase and Assumption of the insured deposits only, where the traditional P&A was modified so that only the insured deposits were assumed by the acquiring institution.\nIDT - Insured Deposit Transfer, where the acquiring institution served as a paying agent for the insurer, established accounts on their books for depositors, and often acquired some assets as well. Includes ABT (asset-backed transfer, a FSLIC transaction that is very similar to an IDT).\nMGR - An institution where FSLIC took over management and generally provided financial assistance. FSLIC closed down before the institution was sold.\nCategory 3\nPO - Payout, where the insurer paid the depositors directly and placed the assets in a liquidating receivership. Note: Includes transactions where the FDIC established a Deposit Insurance National Bank to facilitate the payout process."

            description: >-
              Before 1989, there were two federal deposit insurance funds, one
              administered by the FDIC, which insured deposits in commercial
              banks and state-chartered savings banks, and another administered
              by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC),
              which insured deposits in state- and federally-chartered savings
              associations. In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery
              and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) specified that thereafter the FDIC
              would be the federal deposit insurer of all banks and savings
              associations and would administer both the FDIC fund, which was
              renamed the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the replacement for the
              insolvent FSLIC fund, which was called the Savings Association
              Insurance Fund (SAIF). Although it was created in 1989, the SAIF
              was not responsible for savings association failures until 1996.
              From 1989 through 1995, savings association failures were the
              responsibility of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). In
              February 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005
              provided for the merger of the BIF and the SAIF into a single
              Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Necessary technical and conforming
              changes to the law were made under The Federal Deposit Insurance
              Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005. The merger of the funds
              was effective on March 31, 2006. For additional information about
              deposit insurance fund and legislation, go to

              that institutions that became inactive prior to April 1006 will
              also have zero value.

              Banking institutions fall into one of two ownership types, stock
              or non-stock. An institution which sells stock to raise capital is
              called a stock institution. It is owned by the shareholders who
              benefit from profits earned by the institution. A non-stock
              institution, or mutual institution, is owned and controlled solely
              by its depositors. A mutual does not issue capital stock.

              depository institutions was prohibited.  Now, parent institutions
              are required to file consolidated reports, while their subsidiary
              financial institutions are still required to file separate
              reports.

          SUBCHAPS:
            description: >-
              The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal
              Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S
              corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to
              indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect
              an election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar
              requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements
              to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no
              more than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of
              stock. (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates,
              and certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and
              charitable organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All
              shareholders must consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to
              Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method for
              tax purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad
              debts and recapture tax bad debt reserves over a period of six
              years, if the reserve method had been used prior to conversion.
              (Note: even though the specific charge-off method is required for
              tax purposes, an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses must
              still be maintained on the financial statements and Call Reports.)
              Banks and thrifts are subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if
              the aggregate fair market value of assets is greater than their
              aggregate adjusted bases on the date of conversion to Subchapter S
              status.     [Banks are required to indicate separately on the Call
              Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income
              taxes reported in net income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all
              of their deferred tax assets and liabilities may be eliminated
              upon conversion to Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes
              related to the BIG tax and the recapture of bad debt reserves must
              be recognized.].   A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a
              pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income
              tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income
              taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to
              its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the
              shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of
              this taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing
              institutions' reported income tax expense and increasing their
              after-tax earnings..   The election of Subchapter S status may
              result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liabilities.
              Therefore, S corporations typically increase the amount of
              earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher
              personal taxes.

            description: >-
              The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal
              Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S
              corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to
              indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect
              an election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar
              requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements
              to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no
              more than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of
              stock. (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates,
              and certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and
              charitable organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All
              shareholders must consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to
              Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method for
              tax purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad
              debts and recapture tax bad debt reserves over a period of six
              years, if the reserve method had been used prior to conversion.
              (Note: even though the specific charge-off method is required for
              tax purposes, an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses must
              still be maintained on the financial statements and Call Reports.)
              Banks and thrifts are subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if
              the aggregate fair market value of assets is greater than their
              aggregate adjusted bases on the date of conversion to Subchapter S
              status.     [Banks are required to indicate separately on the Call
              Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income
              taxes reported in net income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all
              of their deferred tax assets and liabilities may be eliminated
              upon conversion to Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes
              related to the BIG tax and the recapture of bad debt reserves must
              be recognized.].   A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a
              pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income
              tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income
              taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to
              its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the
              shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of
              this taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing
              institutions' reported income tax expense and increasing their
              after-tax earnings..   The election of Subchapter S status may
              result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liabilities.
              Therefore, S corporations typically increase the amount of
              earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher
              personal taxes.
